# Brain-Sort

Simple web app that allows the user to sort a small array by swapping elements. 
The amount of swaps is compared against various other sorting algorithms.

Note: Asymptotic behavior should be disreguarded for this, since the array size is so small.
Future versions will try to mitigate this by tracking other metrics of the user's sorting behavior and techniques.
